# Portfolio
building a burial ground / post-battle manga aesthetic portfolio. Think of it as a warrior's resting place where their weapons (swords) tell the story of their skills. The vibe is:

Dark, atmospheric, but not depressing
Skilled veteran who's "been through battles" (projects/experience)
Manga-inspired with limited color palette (black, white, red)
Earthy, grounded (soil texture), with depth (sky and clouds)


## COLOR PALETTE

Black (#0A0A0A): Primary background, text
White (#F2EDE6): Navigation, text, contrast elements
Red (#B1121A): Accents, glows, highlights, transitions
Soil Brown (#3B2A1A): Ground texture, atmospheric base

Purpose: High contrast for readability, red for energy/focus, earthy tones to ground the design.

## HOME PAGE STRUCTURE

Left Side: Three Swords Pierced in Ground

Visual: 3 sword images stuck in mud/high ground
Interaction: When you hover over a sword:

It floats upward (like being pulled from the ground)
A skill label appears (e.g., "Cybersecurity," "Web Development," "Penetration Testing")
Each sword has a different colored glow (radiant effect)

Purpose: Interactive "choose your class" moment that immediately shows your expertise areas

## Right Side: Content Section

Your name (large, bold)
Brief intro text (tagline or description)
Two buttons:

"Projects" (links to portfolio work)
"Contact Me" (links to contact form/info)

Button effect: Black ink text with heat/radiation dispersion animation on hover (ink spreads outward like particles)

## LOADING SCREEN & TRANSITIONS

Between sections (or on initial load): A 3D sword slash effect cuts across the screen
Slash color: Your red accent color
Purpose: Cinematic transition that maintains the sword/combat theme throughout navigation
